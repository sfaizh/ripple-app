# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- Sign-up confirmation email now uses the correct production URL even without `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` set in Vercel — origin is derived from the incoming request as a fallback
- Sign-up page now shows a "Check your email" toast instead of immediately redirecting to `/inbox`; user stays on the page until they click the confirmation link

### Changed
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` to reflect current project state: Next.js 16, anonymous sending behaviour, new routes, production URL, and env var notes

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- PKCE email confirmation handler at `GET /api/auth/confirm` — exchanges Supabase confirmation code for a session and redirects to `/inbox` on success or `/signin?error=confirmation_failed` on failure
- Public compliments feed on wall pages (`/wall/[username]`) — shows the user's approved, opt-in compliments below the send form; cards render fully revealed since senders opted into public display
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` environment variable for canonical redirect URL configuration

### Fixed
- Sign-up confirmation email now redirects to the correct production URL instead of `localhost:3000` — `emailRedirectTo` now passed to `supabase.auth.signUp` using `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- Anonymous compliment sending no longer returns 401 Unauthorized — authentication is now optional on `POST /api/compliments/send`; unauthenticated senders are stored with `senderId = null`
- Auto-approve fallback (dev mode, no pgmq) was not incrementing `totalReceived` for the recipient — now mirrors the moderation worker and increments on approval
- Inbox "Received" stat now queries a live count of approved compliments from the `compliments` table instead of relying on the stale denormalized `users.total_received` value

### Changed
- Rate limiting (10/day) and `totalSent` increment on compliment send are now scoped to authenticated senders only; anonymous senders bypass the rate limit

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-11

### Changed
- Replace Vercel Cron per-minute jobs with cron-job.org for `moderation` and `notifications` workers — Vercel Hobby plan throttles crons to once per day; cron-job.org supports 1-minute intervals for free
- `vercel.json` now only contains the `daily-streak` cron (midnight UTC)

### Documentation
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`: Added Step 3.5 with cron-job.org setup instructions; updated deployment checklist and free-tier limits
- `docs/QUEUE-FUNCTIONS.md`: Updated overview, worker trigger descriptions, event flow diagram, vercel.json example, retry section, and summary table
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Updated tech stack, Flow 1 diagram, and scalability strategy
- `docs/API-ROUTES.md`: Updated trigger notes for moderation and notifications worker routes
- `docs/COSTS.md`: Updated queue processing section to reference cron-job.org
- `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`: Updated `WORKER_SECRET` description to document usage in both Vercel Cron and cron-job.org
- `docs/TODO.md`: Added cron-job.org setup note under AI Moderation checklist

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-11

Initial MVP release of Ripple — an anonymous compliments platform optimized for $0/month hosting.

### Added

#### Infrastructure
- `drizzle.config.ts` with `dotenv` support for `.env.local` in CLI context
- `middleware.ts` for route protection (unauthenticated users redirected to `/signin`)
- `vercel.json` with cron job: daily-streak at midnight (moderation + notifications triggered via cron-job.org)
- `db:push`, `db:generate`, `db:studio`, and `type-check` npm scripts

#### Library Layer
- **Database**: Drizzle schema (`users`, `compliments`) with enums (`theme`, `category`, `clueType`, `moderationStatus`) and indexes
- **Drizzle client**: PgBouncer-compatible (`prepare: false`), pooled + direct URL support
- **Supabase SSR**: `client.ts`, `server.ts`, `middleware.ts` using `@supabase/ssr`
- **Queue**: pgmq `enqueue`/`dequeue`/`ack`/`nack` wrappers via Supabase RPC
- **AI moderation**: Groq SDK (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`) with category-based toxicity scoring
- **Soketi**: Server-side Pusher client for real-time notifications
- **Utils**: `cn()` helper (clsx + tailwind-merge)

#### API Routes (15 endpoints)
- `POST /api/auth/signup` — Creates Supabase auth user + unique username (nanoid)
- `POST /api/auth/signin`, `POST /api/auth/signout`, `GET /api/auth/session`
- `POST /api/compliments/send` — Rate-limited (10/day), enqueues moderation, auto-approves if queue unavailable
- `GET /api/compliments/inbox` — Paginated, filterable by status and read state
- `GET /api/compliments/[id]`, `PATCH /api/compliments/[id]/read`
- `GET /api/compliments/trending` — Public feed with no sender identifiers
- `GET /api/users/[username]` — Public wall data
- `GET /api/users/me/stats`, `PATCH /api/users/me/settings`
- `POST /api/workers/moderation` — Dequeues jobs, runs Groq, updates status, enqueues notifications
- `POST /api/workers/notifications` — Soketi real-time push
- `POST /api/workers/daily-streak` — Streak increment/reset logic
- `POST /api/soketi/auth` — Private channel auth (`private-user-{userId}`)
- `GET /api/health`

#### UI Components
- **ComplimentCard** + **RevealAnimation** — framer-motion blur-to-clear reveal, marks as read on open
- **SendForm** + **CategorySelector** — React Hook Form + Zod, clue selector, char counter, public toggle
- **InboxList** + **InboxFilter** — SWR-powered list, all/unread tabs, skeleton loading states
- **Navbar** — Sticky, auth-aware links and sign-out
- **SoketiProvider** — Dynamic Pusher import, no-op if env vars not set
- **CopyButton** — Clipboard copy for wall link
- **WallSendForm** — Wraps SendForm with post-send success state
- **Base UI**: button, card, input, textarea, badge, skeleton, toast (ToastProvider with context)

#### Pages
- `/` — Landing page with hero section, CTAs, and feature grid
- `/signin` + `/signup` — Auth forms with Zod validation and post-auth redirect
- `/inbox` — Protected: stats row, wall link with copy button, inbox list
- `/wall/[username]` — Public: themed gradient header, send form (or "own wall" message)

#### Documentation
- Replaced Inngest with Supabase pgmq queue functions (`docs/QUEUE-FUNCTIONS.md`)
- Updated all docs to reflect Groq replacing Gemini/Google AI
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` to reflect MVP-complete status and actual project structure
